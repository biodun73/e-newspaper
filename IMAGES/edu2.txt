The Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN) is going after unqualified teachers in public and private schools nationwide.

The Registrar/CEO, Prof. Josiah Ajiboye, made the announcement in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria.

Ajiboye said the council will swing into action once schools fully reopen.

He said despite the grace period given to unqualified teachers, there were still records of many unqualified teachers.

The Registrar said of the four million in various institutions in Nigeria, just over two million were registered with the council.
