
On Wednesday, Roblox raised $520m (Â£394m) in private capital which valued the firm at $29.5bn, a seven-fold increase since February 2020.

Roblox said it would also push ahead with a US share listing, having delayed the move last year.

The company said it will use the fresh funds to build its community and become more of a social platform.

Roblox was first released in 2006, but has seen dramatic growth during the Covid-19 pandemic as children who were forced to stay home spent more time playing games.

Its revenue jumped 91% from a year earlier to $242.2m, Roblox said in its prospectus. Roblox games , which allows users to create avatars across different titles, are free to play but the company sells digital currency called Robux that can buy virtual goods and enhance characters.
