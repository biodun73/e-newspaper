The countdown has started for the fifth phase of the popular “Deposit To Be Returned” program – cheap state loans that thousands of enterprises and freelance professionals are relying on to cover their losses from the lockdown and the Christmas turnover they have missed out on.
In the next two or three days the myBusinessSupport platform is expected to open for applications, with sources saying it will stay open until January 15.

Applicants will have to produce proof that they have suffered a year-on-year reduction of at least 20% in their turnover over the period from September to December 2020 compared to the same time in 2019. Crucially, the funding for the fifth phase will be offset with any funds collected in the fourth phase concerning the lost turnover of the period from October to November. Consequently recipients of loans in the previous phase are set to have their fifth-phase takings reduced.
